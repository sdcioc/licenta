The purpose of this thesis is to implement three new modules for the ENRICHME project, which is
working with robots that interact with humans in a Social Assistive Context. Most of the humans are
eldery people with mild cognitive impairment.
The first two modules are graphical user interface modules: a \textbf{Social Module} which help
the user to connect with his family trough internet,
a \textbf{News Module} which agregates news from different newspapers.
The Social Module offer a chat part and a video-conference part using the WebRTC tehnology.
This thesis provides a new framework over WebRTC which can be used by developers
who does not have a substantial knowledge in networking and WebRTC.
The News Module makes use of the RSS feed and transform it in JSONP which can be used for
secure connections and inside JavaScript scripts. On this news module the thesis provides an experiment
that verify its adaptation.
The third module (\textbf{Heart Rate Bluetooth Sensor Module}) is a ROS module that provides a heart rate sensor
data over a bluetooth low energy connection into a ROS topic.
